# Demo dApp for the ZKHack 2023 Lisbon Hackathon

This is an example application that uses XC-20s, X-Tokens and XCM Transactor to send tokens to another Parachain (Manta in the Moonbase Alpha TestNet) and does a remote XCM Transact in which tokens are transferred from a Multilocation-derivative account (of a contract) to a target address.
